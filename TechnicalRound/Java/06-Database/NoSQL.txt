#What is NoSQL database
-> Nowadays, developers are dealing with a large volume of data which is called big data. 
So naturally, big complexity and big issues will be there. 
Once most of the systems are getting online, so data load increases. 
NoSQL helps to manage unstructured, messy, and complicated data. This is not a traditional database or relational database management.

#Types of NoSQL Database
-> here are four types of mechanisms:
A. Graph database
B. Key value calculation
C. Document oriented
D. Column view presentation


#Difference between vertical and horizontal databases?

        Vertical Database	                            Horizontal Database
-> You can do vertical scaling,                     Here you can do horizontal scaling with more equipment.
    adding more power to the present PC.	
-> All data will be stored in a single node.	    Only part data will be stored in all nodes.
-> Multi-core scaling will be done.	                Single-core scaling will be done.
-> Example: Amazon cloud	                        Example: Cassandra

#when you should use NoSQL in place of the normal database?
-> If you are looking for key-value stores with massive high-speed performances, you can use NoSQL. 
Because in the relational databases, we use ACID transactions. 
Once we use this kind of transaction, the schema-based process will slow down the database performance. 

Suggestive possible situations to use NoSQL are:
A. If you use multiple JOIN queries.
B. If the client wants high traffic site.
C. If you are using denormalized data.

#NoSQL's different features?
Ans: These are different features of NoSQL:

A. It can store a big amount of unstructured, structured, and semi-structured data.
B. It is object-oriented programming based, which is best for a web application.
C. It is agile, sprints based, which is best for project management.
D. It is cost-effective with scale-out architecture and efficiency.
