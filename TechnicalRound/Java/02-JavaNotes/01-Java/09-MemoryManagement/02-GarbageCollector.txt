#Working of a Garbage Collector:

-> JVM triggers this process and as per the JVM garbage collection process is done or else withheld. 
-> It reduces the burden of programmer by automatically performing the allocation or deallocation of memory.
-> Garbage collection process causes the rest of the processes or threads to be paused and thus is costly in nature. 
-> This problem is unacceptable for the client but can be eliminated by applying several garbage collector based algorithms. 
-> This process of applying algorithm is often termed as Garbage Collector tuning and is important for improving the performance of a program.
-> Another solution is the generational garbage collectors that adds an age field to the objects that are assigned a memory. 
-> As more and more objects are created, the list of garbage grows thereby increasing the garbage collection time. 
-> On the basis of how many clock cycles the objects have survived, objects are grouped and are allocated an â€˜ageâ€™ accordingly. 
-> This way the garbage collection work gets distributed.
-> In the current scenario, all garbage collectors are generational, and hence, optimal.



-----------------------------------
Differnt Garbage collector algorithms supported by JVM
1. Serial GC
2. Parallel GC (Throughput GC)
3. CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) GC
4. G1(Garbage First) GC - Default
5. Z GC (ZGC)
6. Epsilon GC (No-Op GC)

==================================================================
Sure! Here's an overview of **how Garbage Collection (GC) works in modern Java** and the key factors and components involved.

## ðŸš€ How Garbage Collection Works in Modern Java

Java's Garbage Collector automatically manages memory by **reclaiming unused objects** so developers don't have to free memory manually.

Modern JVMs (like HotSpot) use **generational GC algorithms** with multiple heaps and sophisticated strategies to optimize throughput and latency.

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts & Components

### 1. **Heap Memory Structure**

Heap is divided into **generations**:

| Generation                   | Purpose                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Young Generation**         | Newly created objects; collected frequently (minor GC)                    |
| **Old (Tenured) Generation** | Objects that survived multiple minor GCs; collected less often (major GC) |
| **Metaspace**                | Stores class metadata (replaced PermGen since Java 8)                     |

Young Gen further split into:

* **Eden Space**: Where new objects are allocated
* **Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1)**: Hold objects surviving one or more minor GCs

---

### 2. **Garbage Collection Phases**

* **Minor GC**: Cleans Young Generation (Eden + one Survivor space). Fast and frequent.
* **Major GC / Full GC**: Cleans Old Generation and sometimes entire heap. Slower and less frequent.
* **Concurrent Phases**: Some GCs do work concurrently with app threads to reduce pauses.

---

### 3. **Types of Collectors in Modern JVM**

* **Serial GC**: Simple single-threaded, for small apps.
* **Parallel GC** (Throughput Collector): Multi-threaded minor and major GC; optimized for throughput.
* **G1 GC (Garbage First)**: Divides heap into regions; does incremental and concurrent collection, balancing pause time and throughput.
* **ZGC** (Z Garbage Collector): Low latency, concurrent, scalable.
* **Shenandoah**: Similar to ZGC, low-pause collector.

---

### 4. **How GC Identifies Garbage**

* JVM roots include references from stack, static fields, JNI handles.
* GC traces reachable objects starting from roots.
* Objects not reachable are eligible for GC.

---

### 5. **Finalization & Reference Types**

* Objects can implement `finalize()` (deprecated now) for cleanup before collection.
* Java supports different reference types affecting GC behavior:

  * **Strong Reference**: Default; prevents GC.
  * **Soft Reference**: GC collects if memory low.
  * **Weak Reference**: Collected more aggressively.
  * **Phantom Reference**: Used to schedule post-GC cleanup.

---

### 6. **Key Factors Affecting GC**

* **Heap size and generation sizes**
* **Allocation rate of objects**
* **Survivor space sizing and promotion thresholds**
* **GC algorithm choice**
* **Application pause time vs throughput requirements**
* **Object lifespan patterns**

---

### 7. **Common JVM GC Flags**

Examples for tuning JVM GC:

```bash
-XX:+UseG1GC               # Use G1 garbage collector
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200   # Target max GC pause time (ms)
-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=45  # When to start concurrent GC in G1
-XX:+PrintGCDetails        # Print GC logs for analysis
-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC    # Use CMS collector (older)
-XX:+UseZGC                # Use Z Garbage Collector (Java 11+)
```

| Aspect                | Explanation                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Heap**              | Memory area split into Young & Old    |
| **Minor GC**          | Cleans young gen, frequent & fast     |
| **Major/Full GC**     | Cleans old gen, slower                |
| **GC Roots**          | Entry points to find live objects     |
| **Collectors**        | Serial, Parallel, G1, ZGC, Shenandoah |
| **Reference Types**   | Strong, Soft, Weak, Phantom           |
| **Tuning Parameters** | Heap size, pause goals, thresholds    |
