#JAVA MEMORY MANAGEMENT

#Java Memory Structure
1. Heap Area
2. Method Area/ Metaspace
3. JVM Stacks
4. Native Method Stack
5. PC Register

1. Heap Area
    -> It is a shared runtime data area and stores the actual object in a memory. 
    -> It is instantiated during the virtual machine start-up.
    -> This memory is allocated for all class instances and array. Heap can be of fixed or dynamic size depending upon the system’s configuration.
    -> JVM provides the user control to initialize or vary the size of heap as per the requirement. 
    -> When a new keyword is used, object is assigned a space in heap, but the reference of the same exists onto the stack.
    -> There exists one and only one heap for a running JVM process.
    -> Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    -> The above statement creates the object of Scanner class which gets allocated to heap whereas the reference ‘sc’ gets pushed to the stack.
    -> Note: Garbage collection in heap area is mandatory.


2. Method Area
    -> It is a logical part of the heap area and is created on virtual machine start-up.
    -> This memory is allocated for class structures, method data and constructor field data, and also for interfaces 
        or special method used in class. 
    -> Heap can be of fixed or dynamic size depending upon the system’s configuration.
    -> Can be of a fixed size or expanded as required by the computation. Needs not to be contiguous.
    -> Note: Though method area is logically a part of heap, it may or may not be garbage collected 
        even if garbage collection is compulsory in heap area.
    
3. JVM Stacks
    -> A stack is created at the same time when a thread is created and is used to store data 
        and partial results which will be needed while returning value for method and performing dynamic linking.
    -> Stacks can either be of fixed or dynamic size. 
    -> The size of a stack can be chosen independently when it is created.
    -> The memory for stack needs not to be contiguous.
    
4. Native Method Stack
    -> Also called as C stacks, native method stacks are not written in Java language. 
    -> This memory is allocated for each thread when its created. And it can be of fixed or dynamic nature.
    
5. PC Register
    -> Each JVM thread which carries out the task of a specific method has a program counter register associated with it. 
    -> The non native method has a PC which stores the address of the available JVM instruction 
        whereas in a native method, the value of program counter is undefined. 
    -> PC register is capable of storing the return address or a native pointer on some specific platform.



=> In Java, the memory structure consists of different areas that are used for various purposes during the execution of a Java program. These areas include:

    1. Heap
    The heap is the area of memory where objects are allocated. It is a runtime data area shared by all threads in a Java application. Objects created using the 'new' keyword are allocated on the heap. The heap is further divided into two regions: the Young Generation and the Old Generation.
    
    - Young Generation: 
        This is where new objects are created. It consists of two parts: Eden space and Survivor spaces (usually two). Objects are initially allocated in the Eden space, and then, through a process called garbage collection, surviving objects are moved to the survivor spaces.
    
    - Old Generation: 
        This region holds objects that have survived multiple garbage collection cycles in the Young Generation. It generally contains long-lived objects and is subject to less frequent garbage collection.
    
    2. Method Area:
    The method area, also known as the permanent generation (PermGen) in older versions of Java, is where class-level structures such as class definitions, static variables, and method bytecode are stored. In Java 8 and later versions, the concept of the permanent generation has been replaced by a new area called the Metaspace, which is allocated from the native memory.
    
    3. Java Stack:
    Each thread in a Java program has its own stack, known as the Java stack. The Java stack holds method-specific variables, method parameters, and intermediate results. Each time a method is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack, and when a method completes, its frame is popped off the stack. The stack is organized as a stack of frames, with each frame corresponding to a method call.
    
    4. PC Register:
    The program counter (PC) register stores the address of the current executing instruction. Each thread has its own PC register, which keeps track of the next instruction to be executed.
    
    5. Native Method Stack:
    The native method stack is used for executing native (non-Java) code. It is separate from the Java stack and contains information related to native methods called from Java code.
    
    6. Direct Memory:
    In addition to the areas mentioned above, Java also provides direct memory access through classes like `ByteBuffer`. Direct memory is allocated outside of the Java heap, in the native memory space, and is managed by the JVM.
    
    It's important to note that the memory structure described above is a simplified representation and can vary across different Java implementations and versions.
    
=====================================
Great question! Let’s dive into **memory management architecture in modern Java (JVM)**—how it’s designed to efficiently manage memory during program execution.

## Memory Management Architecture in Modern Java

At a high level, Java memory management is handled by the JVM, which divides memory into several key areas, each with a specific role.

---

### 1. **JVM Memory Areas**

The JVM specification divides memory into **runtime data areas**, mainly:

| Memory Area                       | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heap**                          | Runtime storage for all objects and arrays (garbage collected)        |
| **Method Area**                   | Stores class metadata, static variables, constants                    |
| **Java Stack**                    | Stores frames for method invocations (local variables, operand stack) |
| **Program Counter (PC) Register** | Holds address of the currently executing JVM instruction              |
| **Native Method Stack**           | For native (non-Java) method calls (depends on JVM implementation)    |

---

### 2. **Heap Memory**

* **All Java objects are allocated on the heap**.
* The heap is the only area subject to **Garbage Collection**.
* Heap is divided into **generations** to optimize GC:

  * **Young Generation**: For newly created objects (divided into Eden and Survivor spaces)
  * **Old Generation (Tenured)**: For long-lived objects
  * **Metaspace** (replaced PermGen since Java 8): Holds class metadata and loaded classes

---

### 3. **Stack Memory**

* Each thread gets its own **Java Stack**.
* Each method call creates a **stack frame** containing:

  * Local variables
  * Operand stack (for computations)
  * Frame data for method return
* Stack is short-lived and used for method execution.
* Stack memory is **not garbage collected**; it’s managed via push/pop operations.

---

### 4. **Method Area / Metaspace**

* Stores class-level information (bytecode, constants, static variables).
* Prior to Java 8, this was called **PermGen** and had fixed size.
* Since Java 8, replaced by **Metaspace**, which is native memory (outside heap) and dynamically sized.
* Helps avoid `OutOfMemoryError` in class loading.

---

### 5. **PC Register**

* Each thread has its own **Program Counter (PC)** register.
* It keeps track of the JVM instruction currently being executed.
* Essential for thread execution management.

---

### 6. **Native Method Stack**

* Used when Java calls native (C/C++) code via JNI.
* Memory for native method calls.

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Object creation           | Objects allocated in Eden space (Young Gen)                      |
| Minor GC                  | Collects garbage in Young Gen; survivors moved to Survivor space |
| Promotion                 | Objects surviving several GC cycles promoted to Old Gen          |
| Major/Full GC             | Cleans Old Gen; more expensive process                           |
| Class metadata management | Stored in Metaspace (native memory)                              |
| Stack frames              | Created and destroyed per method call                            |

## Key Points

* **Heap**: Managed by GC; divided into generations for efficiency.
* **Stack**: Fast, per-thread, stores method state, not GC’d.
* **Metaspace**: Dynamically sized, stores class metadata outside heap.
* JVM manages memory allocation/deallocation, freeing you from manual memory handling.
