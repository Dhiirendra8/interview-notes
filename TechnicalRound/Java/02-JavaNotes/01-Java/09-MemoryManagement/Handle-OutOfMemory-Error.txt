Handling an `OutOfMemoryError` (OOME) at runtime in Java is **tricky** and 
generally signals that your application is **exceeding its memory limits** — 
which is often a **critical condition**, not a recoverable one.


---

## 🔴 1. **Understanding `OutOfMemoryError`**

Common types:

* `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`
* `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded`
* `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace`
* `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create native thread`

---

## ✅ 2. **Immediate Best Practice: Don’t Catch It (Usually)**

`OutOfMemoryError` is an **`Error`**, not an `Exception`. It represents a fatal condition. Catching it might make things worse.

```java
try {
    // risky memory-intensive code
} catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
    // ⚠ Not recommended: may leave app in corrupted state
    System.err.println("OOME occurred: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

If you must catch it (e.g., to log or notify an external system), **terminate or restart gracefully.**

---

## ✅ 3. **How to Prevent or Mitigate It**

### 🔹 a. Monitor Memory Usage

Use tools:

* **JVisualVM**, **JConsole**
* **Prometheus + Grafana**
* **Java Flight Recorder**
* **Memory profilers** (YourKit, Eclipse MAT)

---

### 🔹 b. Set JVM Heap & GC Tuning

```bash
-Xms512m -Xmx2048m -XX:+UseG1GC
```
This means:
    -> Start JVM with 512 MB heap
    -> Allow it to grow up to 2 GC
    -> Use G1GC for efficient and low-pause garbage collection

Tune these settings based on profiling:

* Heap size
* GC algorithm
* Metaspace size (for class metadata)

---

### 🔹 c. Use Soft/Weak/Phantom References

For cache-like or optional memory-hungry objects:

```java
Map<String, SoftReference<HeavyObject>> cache = new HashMap<>();
```

---

### 🔹 d. Clean Up Unused Objects

* Avoid memory leaks (e.g., static collections holding references)
* Use `finally` or `try-with-resources` to release objects
* Close streams, sockets, DB connections

---

### 🔹 e. Use Backpressure or Throttling

If OOME is caused by:

* Loading too much from DB
* Reading large files
* Consuming high-velocity streams (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

→ Apply **pagination**, **batching**, or **rate limiting**

---

### 🔹 f. Use `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`

To generate a heap dump on OOME for postmortem debugging:

```bash
-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/dumps/
```

---

## ✅ 4. Fallback Strategy at Runtime

You may implement a **global handler** for uncaught `OutOfMemoryError`:

```java
Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler((t, e) -> {
    if (e instanceof OutOfMemoryError) {
        // Log it and attempt graceful shutdown
        log.error("FATAL: Out of Memory Error in thread: " + t.getName(), e);
        System.exit(1); // or restart app with a supervisor
    }
});
```

Or using `@ControllerAdvice` for web apps (limited use).

---

## ❌ What Not to Do

* Don’t keep trying to allocate more memory in a `catch (OutOfMemoryError)` block.
* Don’t suppress it and continue running blindly.
* Don’t rely on GC to solve memory leaks automatically.

| Strategy                     | Description                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 📊 Monitor & Profile         | Use tools to observe memory trends    |
| ⚙ GC & Heap tuning           | Adjust JVM options                    |
| 🧹 Clean resources           | Use `try-with-resources`, avoid leaks |
| 🛡 Prevent large allocations | Use pagination, streaming, caching    |
| 🧼 Soft references           | Manage memory-sensitive caches        |
| ⚠ Catch only to log/shutdown | Avoid continuing in an unstable state |
