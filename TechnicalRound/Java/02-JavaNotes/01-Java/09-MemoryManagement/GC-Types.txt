In Java, **Garbage Collection (GC)** is the process of automatically identifying and deleting objects that are no longer in use, to free up memory.

Java provides **multiple types of garbage collectors**, each with different performance characteristics, suited to different types of applications (e.g., low-latency systems, batch processing, etc.).

---

### 🔄 Types of Garbage Collectors in Java

#### 1. **Serial Garbage Collector**

* **Use Case:** Single-threaded environments or small applications (e.g., desktops, embedded).
* **Algorithm:** Stop-the-world using a **single thread** for both minor and major collections.
* **Flag:** `-XX:+UseSerialGC`

---

#### 2. **Parallel Garbage Collector (Throughput Collector)**

* **Use Case:** Applications where **throughput** is more important than low latency.
* **Algorithm:** Uses **multiple threads** for GC work, including compaction.
* **Also called:** Throughput Collector.
* **Flag:** `-XX:+UseParallelGC`

---

#### 3. **CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) Garbage Collector** 🚫 (Deprecated in Java 9, removed in Java 14)

* **Use Case:** Applications requiring **low pause times**.
* **Algorithm:** Performs most of the GC concurrently with the application threads.
* **Issue:** Memory fragmentation.
* **Flag:** `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`

---

#### 4. **G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector**

* **Use Case:** Balanced applications needing **low pause times** and **good throughput**.
* **Algorithm:** Divides the heap into regions and collects garbage in selected regions.
* **Feature:** Predictable pauses, compacts the heap.
* **Default** in Java 9–14.
* **Flag:** `-XX:+UseG1GC`

---

#### 5. **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)**

* **Use Case:** Applications requiring **very low pause times** (less than 10ms), even with large heaps (up to terabytes).
* **Algorithm:** Mostly concurrent; pause times are independent of heap size.
* **Flag:** `-XX:+UseZGC`
* **Introduced in:** Java 11 (stable in Java 15)

---

#### 6. **Shenandoah GC**

* **Use Case:** Low pause time requirements with **less overhead** than ZGC.
* **Algorithm:** Concurrent compaction, pause times are also independent of heap size.
* **Flag:** `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`
* **Developed by:** Red Hat
* **Introduced in:** Java 12 (stable in later versions)

### 📊 Summary Table

| GC Type          | Multi-threaded | Pause Time | Heap Size Support | Use Case                |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Serial           | ❌              | High       | Small             | Simple apps             |
| Parallel         | ✅              | Medium     | Medium–Large      | High throughput         |
| CMS (Deprecated) | ✅              | Low        | Medium            | Low pause needs         |
| G1               | ✅              | Low–Medium | Medium–Large      | General purpose         |
| ZGC              | ✅              | Very Low   | Huge (TBs)        | Low-latency, large heap |
| Shenandoah       | ✅              | Very Low   | Medium–Large      | Responsive applications |

---

### ✅ Choosing the Right Collector

* **Simple app / small memory**: Serial GC
* **High throughput batch jobs**: Parallel GC
* **Responsive services (web apps, APIs)**: G1, Shenandoah, or ZGC
* **Large heap & ultra-low latency**: ZGC or Shenandoah



===============================================================
Great question! The **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep)** garbage collector was deprecated in **Java 9** and removed in **Java 14**, and here’s why:

---

## ❌ Why CMS Was Deprecated and Removed

### 🧱 1. **Code Complexity**

* CMS had a **complex implementation** inside the JVM.
* Hard to maintain and evolve with newer garbage collection techniques.

### 🐞 2. **Fragmentation Issues**

* CMS does **not compact memory** in the old generation.
* Leads to **heap fragmentation**, which can cause **allocation failures** even when enough memory is available.

### 💤 3. **Stop-the-World Pauses Still Exist**

* While CMS is mostly concurrent, it still has:

  * Initial Mark (stop-the-world)
  * Final Remark (stop-the-world)
* Not ideal for ultra-low-latency applications.

### ⚡ 4. **Better Alternatives Exist**

* **G1 GC** (introduced in Java 7u4, default in Java 9) offers:

  * Predictable pause times
  * Compaction
  * Works better for both small and large heaps
* **ZGC** and **Shenandoah** are even more advanced (sub-millisecond pause times)

### 🔁 5. **No Longer Evolving**

* Oracle and the OpenJDK community stopped adding improvements to CMS.
* Focus shifted to **G1**, **ZGC**, and **Shenandoah** for innovation.

## 📢 Official Deprecation Note (from JEP 291)

> *"The CMS collector is deprecated in JDK 9, and we intend to remove it in a future release. We want to invest in collectors that are easier to maintain and scale better for modern workloads."*

## ✅ Recommended Replacements

| Use Case                 | Recommended GC           | Notes                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| General-purpose          | **G1 GC**                | Default since Java 9        |
| Ultra-low pause latency  | **ZGC** / **Shenandoah** | Pause times <10ms; Java 11+ |
| Large heaps (GBs to TBs) | **ZGC**                  | Scales to terabytes         |

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Reason CMS Deprecated   | Why It Matters                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Too complex to maintain | JVM evolution slowed down         |
| Causes fragmentation    | Leads to OOM despite free memory  |
| Not future-proof        | G1 and others perform better      |
| Limited scalability     | Not ideal for large-scale systems |
