Great question â€” **concurrency** and **multithreading** are related but distinct concepts in Java and computer science. Here's a clear breakdown:

---

### âœ… **Concurrency**

* **Definition**: The ability of a program to **handle multiple tasks at once**, potentially making progress on more than one task **without necessarily running them simultaneously**.
* **Goal**: Manage multiple tasks efficiently by interleaving execution (e.g., through task scheduling).
* **Example**: A single-core CPU switching between tasks (Task A â†’ Task B â†’ Task A).

#### ðŸ”¸ Think of it as:

> Managing multiple tasks over time, giving the illusion of parallelism.

---

### âœ… **Multithreading**

* **Definition**: A specific way to achieve concurrency by using **multiple threads** within the same process.
* **Goal**: Divide work across threads to achieve concurrent (and sometimes parallel) execution.
* **Example**: A Java program creating multiple threads to perform logging, data processing, and UI rendering at once.

#### ðŸ”¸ Think of it as:

> A technique (among others) to implement concurrency using threads.

### âœ… Key Differences:

| Aspect           | Concurrency                            | Multithreading                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Concept          | Design principle                       | Execution model                         |
| Implementation   | Can use threads, processes, coroutines | Specifically uses multiple threads      |
| Goal             | Manage multiple tasks efficiently      | Execute multiple threads simultaneously |
| CPU Cores Needed | Can run on a single core               | Can benefit from multiple cores         |
| Java Example     | ExecutorService, CompletableFuture     | `Thread`, `Runnable`, `synchronized`    |
