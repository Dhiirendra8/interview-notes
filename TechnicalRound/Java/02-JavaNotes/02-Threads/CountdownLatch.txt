In Java, a **`CountDownLatch`** is a synchronization aid provided by the `java.util.concurrent` package. 
It allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed by other threads is completed.

---

## 🔧 **Basic Concept**

A `CountDownLatch` is initialized with a **count** (an integer). Threads can:

* **Wait** for the count to reach zero using `await()`
* **Decrease** the count using `countDown()`

Once the count reaches zero, **all waiting threads are released**.

---

## 🧠 **Analogy**:

Think of it like a starting gate in a race — the runners (threads) wait until all gates (conditions) are open (count reaches zero), then they start running.

---

## ✅ **Use Case Example**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class CountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int numTasks = 3;
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numTasks);

        // Worker threads
        for (int i = 1; i <= numTasks; i++) {
            new Thread(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is doing work");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // simulate work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
                latch.countDown(); // reduce count by 1
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished work");
            }, "Worker-" + i).start();
        }

        // Main thread waits for workers to finish
        latch.await();
        System.out.println("All workers are done. Main thread continues.");
    }
}
```

### 📝 Output (approx):

```
Worker-1 is doing work
Worker-2 is doing work
Worker-3 is doing work
Worker-1 finished work
Worker-2 finished work
Worker-3 finished work
All workers are done. Main thread continues.
```

## 📌 **Key Methods**

| Method        | Description                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `countDown()` | Decreases the count by 1           |
| `await()`     | Waits until the count reaches zero |
| `getCount()`  | Returns the current count          |

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

* A `CountDownLatch` **cannot be reset**. Once the count reaches zero, it's dead.
* If you need a reusable version, consider using **`CyclicBarrier`** or **`Semaphore`**.


==============================
### ✅ `CountDownLatch` vs `CyclicBarrier` in Java

Both `CountDownLatch` and `CyclicBarrier` are synchronization aids in `java.util.concurrent`, but they serve **different purposes** and are used in **different scenarios**.

### 🔍 Key Differences:

| Feature            | `CountDownLatch`                   | `CyclicBarrier`                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**        | One-time event trigger             | Wait until a fixed number of threads reach barrier |
| **Resettable**     | ❌ No                               | ✅ Yes (can be reused/cycled)                       |
| **Thread waiting** | One or more threads wait for latch | Multiple threads wait for each other               |
| **Use case**       | Wait until N tasks complete        | Start N threads together at a common point         |
| **Implemented as** | Counter that counts down to zero   | Barrier that blocks until all parties arrive       |
| **Common method**  | `countDown()`, `await()`           | `await()`                                          |
| **Reusability**    | One-time use                       | Can be reused multiple times                       |
| **Barrier Action** | ❌ Not supported                    | ✅ Optional action to run once all arrive           |

---

### ✅ Example Use Cases:

#### 🔹 `CountDownLatch`:

> **Main thread waits for workers to finish** (e.g., test harness, startup sequence)

```java
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        // Do some work
        latch.countDown(); // Decrease count
    }).start();
}

latch.await(); // Main thread waits
System.out.println("All tasks completed.");
```

---

#### 🔹 `CyclicBarrier`:

> **All threads wait for each other before proceeding** (e.g., multiplayer game, simulation step)

```java
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, () -> {
    System.out.println("All threads reached barrier. Proceeding...");
});

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is waiting");
            barrier.await(); // Wait at barrier
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " continues");
        } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
    }).start();
}
```

### 🧠 Summary:

| Want to...                                          | Use                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Wait for multiple tasks to finish before continuing | `CountDownLatch`                      |
| Let threads wait for each other at a common point   | `CyclicBarrier`                       |
| Use same barrier multiple times                     | `CyclicBarrier`                       |
| Trigger an action once when all threads arrive      | `CyclicBarrier` (with barrier action) |
| Perform a one-time wait                             | `CountDownLatch`                      |
