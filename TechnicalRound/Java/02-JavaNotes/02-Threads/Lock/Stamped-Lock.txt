`StampedLock` is a **concurrency utility** in Java (`java.util.concurrent.locks`) introduced in **Java 8**, designed for advanced locking with **better performance in read-heavy systems** compared to traditional locks like `ReentrantReadWriteLock`.

---

### üîê What is `StampedLock`?

It provides:

* **Exclusive write locks**
* **Shared read locks**
* **Optimistic read locks**

And it uses a **stamp (a `long` value)** to manage the lock state.

### üîπ Key Features:

| Type                  | Description                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `writeLock()`         | Exclusive lock. Only one thread can write.                                   |
| `readLock()`          | Shared lock. Multiple threads can read concurrently.                         |
| `tryOptimisticRead()` | Very lightweight. Doesn‚Äôt block. If no write occurs during read, it's valid. |
| `validate(stamp)`     | Confirms if optimistic read is still valid (no write happened).              |

### ‚úÖ Example Usage:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock;

public class StampedLockExample {
    private int balance = 0;
    private final StampedLock lock = new StampedLock();

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        long stamp = lock.writeLock();
        try {
            balance += amount;
        } finally {
            lock.unlockWrite(stamp);
        }
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        long stamp = lock.tryOptimisticRead();
        int current = balance;
        // Validate the stamp to ensure no write occurred
        if (!lock.validate(stamp)) {
            stamp = lock.readLock(); // fallback to read lock
            try {
                current = balance;
            } finally {
                lock.unlockRead(stamp);
            }
        }
        return current;
    }
}
```

### üß† Why Use `StampedLock`?

* **Optimistic reads** are **non-blocking** and **faster** when you expect **few writes**.
* Can reduce contention and increase throughput in **read-heavy applications**.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

* **StampedLock is not reentrant** ‚Äì a thread cannot reacquire a lock it already holds.
* Not suitable for scenarios needing **lock upgrading** (read ‚Üí write), unless done carefully.
* Stamps must be managed properly to avoid **deadlocks or invalid unlocks**.
