How to install Bootstrap for Angular project?

1. npm install --save bootstrap@3  => The @3  is important!  

Further, when you use a project created with Angular CLI 6+ (check via ng v ), you'll have an angular.json file instead of an .angular-cli.json file. 
In that file, you still need to add Bootstrap to the styles[] array, but the path should be node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css , 
	NOT ../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css . The leading ../ must not be included.
	
How to add bootstrap.css file in the project?
1. Expand Node Module (library root folder)
2. Go to bootstrap folder and expand it.
3. Go to dist folder and expand dist.
4. Expand css and you will find "bootstrap.css". Expand bootstrap.css and you will see bootstrap.min.css
5. Open angular.json file and add the bootstrap.min.css in style section.
	"styles": [  
	"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",  
	"src/styles.css"  
	],

1. Interpolation
	{{}}
	
2. Component
	ng generate component component-name
	ng g c component-name
	
3. Component with inline style and inline template
	ng g c inline-style-component --inline-style
	ng g c inline-template-component --inline-template
	ng g c inline-style-template-component --inline-template --inline-style
	
4. Module
	ng generate module moduleName
	- register this module in app module
	- If you create components in custom module then you need to export the components in module file to globally exposed the new created components
		exports: [
			NewModuleComponentComponent
		  ]
5. function and Events
	- Events : click, keyup, keydown, input, mouseover, mouseleave, blur
	<h1 (mouseleave)="fun1()">{{title}}</h1>
	<h1 (mouseover)="fun1()">{{title}}</h1>
