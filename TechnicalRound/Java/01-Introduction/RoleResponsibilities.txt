### ✅ Sample Answer:

> In my current role as a **Senior Application Developer**, 
I’m primarily responsible for designing and developing **microservices-based applications** 
using **Java 17, Spring Boot, and Kafka**.

> I work closely with architects and product owners to translate business requirements into scalable, 
production-ready services. 

> I’m also involved in:
    - Writing and reviewing REST APIs
    - Implementing asynchronous communication via Kafka topics
    - Integrating with third-party APIs and handling edge cases like retries, rate limiting, and DLQs
    - Ensuring observability using tools like ELK and Prometheus\n- Managing deployments on AWS via CI/CD pipelines\n\nIn addition to development, I actively contribute to **code reviews**, **mentoring junior team members**, and **performance tuning**. I’m also comfortable working with Docker, Git, and container orchestration setups like ECS and EKS.\n\nOverall, my role is a healthy mix of hands-on coding, design-level thinking, and collaboration with cross-functional teams.”

=============================
Great question! Asking smart, thoughtful questions in a **Role/Profile Discussion call at Wipro** shows that you're serious, proactive, and focused on long-term fit.

Here are some meaningful and professional questions you can ask during the call, categorized by topic:

---

## 🧩 1. **About the Project/Role**

✔️ *“Can you please share more details about the project I’d be aligned to?”*
✔️ *“Is this a new development project or maintenance/enhancement?”*
✔️ *“What technologies or tools are primarily used in this project?”*
✔️ *“Will this role involve client communication or stakeholder interaction?”*

---

## 🧠 2. **About the Team/Work Culture**

✔️ *“How big is the team I’ll be working with?”*
✔️ *“Is it a collaborative agile setup or more siloed work?”*
✔️ *“Will there be opportunities for mentoring or taking ownership of modules?”*

---

## ☁️ 3. **Tech Stack & Learning Opportunities**

✔️ *“Are there chances to work on cloud technologies or microservices, if not already part of the stack?”*
✔️ *“Does the team follow DevOps practices like CI/CD, containerization, etc.?”*
✔️ *“Does Wipro support certifications or internal trainings in advanced tech stacks?”*

---

## 🌐 4. **Remote Work / Location / Shift**

✔️ *“Is this a fully remote, hybrid, or on-site role?”*
✔️ *“Are there any specific shift timings or weekend support expectations?”*
✔️ *“If relocation is required, how much flexibility is there for joining remotely initially?”*

---

## 💼 5. **Career Growth & Long-Term Fit**

✔️ *“What kind of growth path do you foresee in this role over the next 1–2 years?”*
✔️ *“Is internal movement to other projects or technologies encouraged after some time?”*

---

## ❗ Questions to Avoid:

* ❌ “How much salary can you offer?” (ask only in HR calls)
* ❌ “How soon can I be released from this project?”
* ❌ “Can I skip weekends if I don’t like the client timings?” 😅

---

## 🎯 Best Practice:

> End with:
> **“Is there anything you’d like to know from me to better evaluate my fit for this role?”**

This makes the conversation two-sided and shows openness.

Would you like me to help you prepare a **personalized list based on your profile**, or write a polite script to ask these questions?
