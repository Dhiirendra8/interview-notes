# Projects and role in it

Roles and Responsibilities : 
	-> Gathering the requirements from the customers along with grooming discussion 
	-> involved majorly into implementation of the changes, unit testing and bug fixing

“I’m currently working as a Senior Backend Developer on a microservices-based stock trading platform. 
My role involves designing and developing RESTful APIs using Java, Spring Boot, and Kafka, and ensuring system scalability and security.
My day-to-day responsibilities include:
	- Writing clean, testable, and production-grade code
	- Designing microservice APIs and integrating with third-party systems (like payment gateways or market feeds)
	- Handling asynchronous messaging using Kafka
	- Leading code reviews and helping junior team members
	- Working closely with DevOps for CI/CD and production deployment
	- Collaborating with product managers to refine requirements
	
I also take ownership of performance tuning and have implemented caching and retry strategies to improve system resilience. 
As a result, we were able to reduce API response time by 40% and handle over 5000 requests/sec reliably.”

#
I'm directly working and reporting to Client so I always communicate with them about expected due dates for my assignments first. 
Then I create my own deadline based on my assigned due dates. 
Typically, I like to give myself at least a day or two in advance, that way I can complete my work and still have time to review everything 
thoroughly before turning it in.

-------------------------------------------------------------

In the project (TSB- Digital Decoupling) currently I'm working, I am the most experienced developer from Accenture 
so I can lead the development process from scratch within the team.

-------------------------------------------------------------

I have just started my journey with Accenture and also with TSB so I'm learning day by day and doing tasks while keeping my priorities along with me. 
Since my development team is very small there are only 2 developers so we are helping each other, dividing our tasks and try to complete them within 
the deadlines.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Initially before coming to TSB project I haven't get opportunity to work on advance API development technologies such as SpringBoot 
(I have working knowledge in Spring Core and Spring MVC), Kafka, Scylla (Cassandra), Consul, Reactive Programming, Jenkins Pipeline, AWS etc. 
and in this project the Client is using all the above in development so I learned enough by myself to do my task in development and 
I am still learning day by day with new challenges. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

I'm doing the java development from past 5 years and I would like to get other opportunities, roles and responsibilities.
