Excellent question! Reviewing a **Pull Request (PR)** is a critical step in maintaining **code quality, team consistency, and application stability**. Here’s a clear checklist of what to look for when reviewing a PR — whether you’re a tech lead, senior developer, or team member.

---

## ✅ 1. **Correctness**

* Does the code do **what it’s supposed to**?
* Are all **business requirements or bug fixes** handled properly?
* Are **edge cases** and **error scenarios** considered?
* Are there any **null pointer risks** or unchecked inputs?

---

## ✅ 2. **Code Quality & Cleanliness**

* Is the code **readable**, **clean**, and **well-structured**?
* Are variables, methods, and classes named **meaningfully**?
* Is the code **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself) — no unnecessary duplication?
* Are there unnecessary comments or commented-out code blocks?
* Is exception handling done properly?

---

## ✅ 3. **Adherence to Project Standards**

* Does it follow the team’s **coding conventions** (e.g., formatting, naming)?
* Does it follow the project’s **architecture and layering** (e.g., controller → service → repository)?
* Are configurations externalized correctly (properties, YAML)?

---

## ✅ 4. **Test Coverage**

* Are **unit tests** or **integration tests** included for the new/changed code?
* Are **mocking and assertions** used properly?
* Are the tests meaningful, or just passing trivially?

---

## ✅ 5. **Performance & Efficiency**

* Are there any **unnecessary DB/API calls**, or can logic be optimized?
* Are stream operations, loops, and queries efficient for the expected data size?
* Is caching considered where applicable?

---

## ✅ 6. **Security**

* Is sensitive data (passwords, tokens) handled securely (no logging/output)?
* Are proper validations, escaping, and sanitization used?
* Are auth/role checks in place for sensitive endpoints?

---

## ✅ 7. **Scalability and Future-Proofing**

* Will this code still perform well if data or users scale?
* Is the design flexible for likely changes or extensions?

---

## ✅ 8. **Documentation & Comments**

* Is the logic **self-explanatory**, or is a comment warranted?
* Are **API methods**, **complex logic**, or **public interfaces** well-documented?

---

## ✅ 9. **Build & CI Checks**

* Does the PR pass **unit tests**, **lint checks**, and **CI pipeline**?
* Are there merge conflicts or outdated files?

---

## ✅ 10. **Dependencies & External Changes**

* Are there any new dependencies added? Are they necessary and secure?
* Are version changes intentional?
* Are any environment/config changes clearly documented?

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tips for Reviewers:

* Be **constructive**, not critical.
* Use a checklist or GitHub PR template if your team has one.
* Don’t rush — quality reviews save time later.

---

### 📝 Sample Review Comments:

* ✅ “Nice use of `Optional` here — handles null safety well.”
* ⚠️ “Can we add a unit test to cover this failure scenario?”
* 🚫 “Let’s avoid logging sensitive data like password/email.”
* 🧠 “Consider extracting this logic into a service method for reusability.”
