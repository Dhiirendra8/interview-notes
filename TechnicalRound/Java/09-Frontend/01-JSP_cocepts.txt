JSP

- JSP technology is used to create web application just like Servlet technology
- It can be thought of as an extension to Servlet because it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language, 
	JSTL (Java Standard Tag Library), etc.
	
The Lifecycle of a JSP Page

	1. Translation of JSP Page
	2. Compilation of JSP Page
	3. Classloading (the classloader loads class file)
	4. Instantiation (Object of the Generated Servlet is created).
	5. Initialization ( the container invokes jspInit() method).
	6. Request processing ( the container invokes _jspService() method).
	7. Destroy ( the container invokes jspDestroy() method).
	
JSP Scriptlet tag (Scripting elements)
	1. JSP scriptlet tag
		-  to execute java source code
		<%  java source code %>  
	
	2. JSP expression tag
		- The code placed within JSP expression tag is written to the output stream of the response
		<%= "welcome to jsp" %>  
	
	3. JSP declaration tag
		- to declare fields and methods
		- The code written inside the jsp declaration tag is placed outside the service() method of auto generated servlet.
			So it doesn't get memory at each request.
		- <%!  field or method declaration %>  
		
		
JSP directives
	1. JSP page directive
		- The page directive defines attributes that apply to an entire JSP page.
		- Attributes of JSP page directive
			import, contentType, extends, info, buffer, language, isELIgnored, isThreadSafe, autoFlush, session, pageEncoding, errorPage, isErrorPage
		
		- <%@ page attribute="value" %>  
	2. JSP include directive
		- 
	3. JSP taglib directive
