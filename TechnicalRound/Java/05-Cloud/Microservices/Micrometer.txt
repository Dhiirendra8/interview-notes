**Micrometer** is a **metrics and observability facade** for Java applications. 
Think of it as **SLF4J but for metrics**.

### üîß In simple terms:

Micrometer helps your **Spring Boot** or **Java application** collect metrics like:

* JVM memory usage
* HTTP request count and duration
* Database connection stats
* Custom business metrics (e.g., orders placed)

It then sends those metrics to **monitoring systems** like:

* Prometheus
* Datadog
* New Relic
* Graphite
* CloudWatch

## ‚úÖ Key Features of Micrometer

| Feature                        | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Facade over metric systems** | Works with Prometheus, Datadog, etc.                    |
| **Built into Spring Boot**     | Spring Boot Actuator uses Micrometer under the hood     |
| **Custom metrics**             | You can define your own counters, timers, gauges        |
| **Minimal overhead**           | Designed for performance and production use             |
| **Tags/dimensions**            | Metrics can be labeled/tagged for filtering/aggregation |

## üß© Micrometer Metrics Types

| Metric Type           | Purpose                        | Example                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `Counter`             | Monotonically increasing count | Number of API calls          |
| `Timer`               | Tracks duration + count        | HTTP response times          |
| `Gauge`               | Measures a value at a point    | Current memory usage         |
| `DistributionSummary` | Tracks sizes                   | Payload sizes, order amounts |
| `LongTaskTimer`       | Tracks long tasks              | Background job durations     |

## üîç Example in Spring Boot

### `application.yml` for Prometheus:

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
  metrics:
    tags:
      application: my-service
```

### Expose metrics endpoint:

Visit:

```
http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics
http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus
```

---

## üìå Custom Metric Example

```java
@Autowired
MeterRegistry meterRegistry;

@PostConstruct
public void init() {
    meterRegistry.counter("orders.created").increment();
}
```

This creates a metric like:

```
orders_created_total{application="order-service"} 1.0
```

---

## ‚úÖ Micrometer + Tracing

Micrometer also supports **distributed tracing** (replacing Sleuth) via:

* **micrometer-tracing-bridge-brave** ‚Üí For Zipkin
* **micrometer-tracing-bridge-otel** ‚Üí For OpenTelemetry

This enables:

* Tracing spans across services
* Trace ID and span ID in logs
* Integration with Zipkin, Jaeger, etc.

## üß† Summary

| Feature       | Sleuth         | Micrometer             |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Metrics       | ‚ùå              | ‚úÖ Yes                  |
| Tracing       | ‚úÖ (deprecated) | ‚úÖ (via Tracing Bridge) |
| Actuator base | Partial        | Full integration       |
| Modern usage  | ‚ùå Deprecated   | ‚úÖ Spring Boot 3+       |
