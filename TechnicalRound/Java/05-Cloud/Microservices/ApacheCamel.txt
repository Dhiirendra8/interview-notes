### Apache Camel
- Camel is a black box that receives messages from some endpoint and sends it to another one. 
	Within the black box, the messages may be processed or simply redirected.
- It is a message-oriented middleware that provides rule-based routing and mediation engine
- Camel supports the Message Endpoint from the EIP patterns using the Endpoint interface.

##Architecture
- The Camel architecture consists 3 components âˆ’ Integration Engine and Router, Processors, and Components.
	#Components: 
		- The Components module provides an Endpoint interface to the external world. 
		- The Endpoints are specified by URIs, such as file:/order and jms:orderQueue
	#Processors: 
		- The Processors module is used for manipulating and mediating messages between Endpoints
	#Integration Engine and Router: 
		- The Processors and Endpoints are wired together in Integration Engine and Router module using DSLs. 
		- While wiring these, you may use filters to filter messages based on user-defined criteria
