1. What are the recent issue you faced in your project?
==============================================================================
2. In Stock market application where you need to deal with real time data and you use 3rd party APIs which is having their own rate limiting
    like 25 hits per minute. How would you scale you microservices.

    Great scenario! A **stock market application** consuming **real-time data from third-party APIs with rate limits** (e.g., 25 requests/min) is a **classic case of designing for scalability and resilience under external constraints**.

---

## ‚úÖ Problem Breakdown:

* You're consuming **real-time stock data** (e.g., prices, ticks).
* The **third-party API allows only 25 requests/min** (rate-limited).
* Your **internal microservices** may have hundreds or thousands of client requests.
* You need to **scale the system** without breaking the rate limits or causing throttling/errors.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Strategy: Scalable, Rate-Aware Architecture

### üîπ 1. **Introduce a Smart Gateway or API Adapter Layer**

Create a **dedicated API proxy/microservice** that:

* **Centralizes** all requests to the third-party API
* Applies **rate limiting, caching, batching**, and **fallbacks**

```text
[Clients] ‚Üí [Stock Service] ‚Üí [API Gateway Adapter] ‚Üí [3rd Party API]
```

---

### üîπ 2. **Implement Rate Limiting (25 req/min)**

* Use libraries like **Bucket4j**, **Resilience4j RateLimiter**, or **Guava RateLimiter**.
* Enforce per-key limits to throttle excess internal calls.
* Ensure rate limiter is **distributed** (e.g., Redis-backed) in a scaled environment.

```java
RateLimiter limiter = RateLimiter.of("stockApi", 
   RateLimiterConfig.custom().limitForPeriod(25)
   .limitRefreshPeriod(Duration.ofMinutes(1)).build());
```

---

### üîπ 3. **Use Local + Distributed Caching**

* Use **in-memory cache** (e.g., Caffeine) for fast access.
* Add **Redis cache** to share across instances.
* Cache stock values with a short TTL (5‚Äì30 sec) ‚Äî stocks don't change every millisecond.

```java
@Cacheable(value = "stocks", key = "#symbol", cacheManager = "redisCacheManager")
public StockPrice getStockPrice(String symbol) {
    return externalApiClient.fetchStock(symbol);
}
```

---

### üîπ 4. **Introduce Request Batching**

Instead of hitting the API 25 times for 25 stocks:

* Batch into **1 request with multiple symbols** if the API supports it.
* Use tools like **RxJava**, **Akka**, or **custom batcher service**.

---

### üîπ 5. **Asynchronous Event-Driven Design**

* Use **Kafka or RabbitMQ** to queue requests.
* The batch processor consumes from Kafka and invokes external API at rate-safe intervals.

```text
[Client Request] ‚Üí [Kafka Queue] ‚Üí [Worker Service] ‚Üí [API ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Response]
```

---

### üîπ 6. **Use Circuit Breaker and Fallbacks**

To avoid overloading and cascading failures:

```java
@CircuitBreaker(name = "stockApi", fallbackMethod = "fallbackStockPrice")
public StockPrice fetchFromApi(String symbol) {
    return restTemplate.getForObject(...);
}
```

---

### üîπ 7. **Horizontal Scaling with Intelligent Throttling**

* Run multiple instances of your service but **synchronize rate limit using Redis or distributed locks**.
* **Leader election or partitioning** can help ensure only one instance makes external calls.

---

### üîπ 8. **Monitoring & Alerting**

* Track **API call count, failures, fallback rate, latency**.
* Use **Prometheus + Grafana**, or **ELK + APM**.

## ‚úÖ Tech Stack Summary:

| Component       | Tool / Framework                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Rate Limiting   | Resilience4j, Bucket4j, Redis-based |
| Caching         | Redis, Caffeine                     |
| Messaging Queue | Kafka / RabbitMQ                    |
| Circuit Breaker | Resilience4j                        |
| Batching        | Custom batcher / RxJava / Akka      |
| Monitoring      | Prometheus + Grafana / ELK          |

---

## üß† Real-World Analogy:

Think of it like this: the **external API is a tap**, and your **user traffic is a flood**. You need **buckets (rate limiters)**, **storage tanks (cache)**, and **flow control (queues)** to balance it.

5. How to securily connect to Kafka
Connecting securely to Apache Kafka involves a combination of **authentication**, **authorization**, and **encryption**. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to connect to Kafka **securely** in a production-grade setup:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Enable **TLS/SSL Encryption** (for secure data transfer)

### üîπ Why?

To **encrypt data in transit** between producers, brokers, and consumers.

### üîß How?

In `server.properties` (on Kafka broker):

```properties
listeners=SSL://<broker-host>:9093
security.inter.broker.protocol=SSL
ssl.keystore.location=/path/to/kafka.server.keystore.jks
ssl.keystore.password=changeit
ssl.key.password=changeit
ssl.truststore.location=/path/to/kafka.server.truststore.jks
ssl.truststore.password=changeit
```

In **client (Java)**:

```java
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("bootstrap.servers", "broker:9093");
props.put("security.protocol", "SSL");
props.put("ssl.truststore.location", "/path/to/truststore.jks");
props.put("ssl.truststore.password", "changeit");
props.put("ssl.keystore.location", "/path/to/keystore.jks");
props.put("ssl.keystore.password", "changeit");
props.put("ssl.key.password", "changeit");
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Enable **Authentication**

Kafka supports multiple authentication mechanisms:

| Method               | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **SSL**              | Mutual certificate-based auth                 |
| **SASL/PLAIN**       | Username/password-based auth (base64 encoded) |
| **SASL/SCRAM**       | Secure password hashing                       |
| **SASL/OAUTHBEARER** | Token-based (OAuth 2.0/JWT)                   |

### üîß Example: SASL/SCRAM

Broker:

```properties
listeners=SASL_SSL://<broker-host>:9094
security.inter.broker.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanism.inter.broker.protocol=SCRAM-SHA-512
sasl.enabled.mechanisms=SCRAM-SHA-512
```

Client:

```java
props.put("security.protocol", "SASL_SSL");
props.put("sasl.mechanism", "SCRAM-SHA-512");
props.put("sasl.jaas.config",
   "org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required " +
   "username=\"user\" password=\"pass\";");
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Enable **Authorization** (ACLs)

### üîπ Why?

To control **who can access what** in Kafka.

### üîß Enable ACLs:

In `server.properties`:

```properties
authorizer.class.name=kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer
allow.everyone.if.no.acl.found=false
```

### üîß Create ACLs:

```bash
# Allow user to write to a topic
bin/kafka-acls.sh --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181 \
--add --allow-principal User:alice --operation Write --topic my-topic
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Secure ZooKeeper (if used)

Zookeeper is Kafka‚Äôs metadata store (Kafka 2.x). Secure it with:

* `zookeeper.ssl.client.enable=true`
* `authProvider.1=org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.SASLAuthenticationProvider`

Note: Kafka 3.x supports **KRaft mode**, which eliminates Zookeeper.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Use a Secure Kafka Client (Spring Boot example)

```yaml
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: broker:9094
    security:
      protocol: SASL_SSL
    properties:
      sasl.mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
      sasl.jaas.config: >
        org.apache.kafka.common.security.scram.ScramLoginModule required
        username="alice" password="password";
      ssl.truststore.location: classpath:truststore.jks
      ssl.truststore.password: changeit
```

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Best Practices

| Area         | Recommendation                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Encryption   | Always enable **SSL/TLS** for external access                      |
| AuthN/AuthZ  | Use **SASL/SCRAM** or **OAUTHBEARER** (no plaintext)               |
| Certificates | Use signed, rotated certificates (e.g., via Vault or cert-manager) |
| Firewall     | Restrict access to Kafka ports                                     |
| Monitoring   | Monitor with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Audit logs**           |
| Secrets      | Never hardcode passwords; use **Vault/KMS/Secrets Manager**        |
