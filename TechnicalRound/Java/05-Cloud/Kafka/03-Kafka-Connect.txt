Here are some common Kafka Connect interview questions along with their answers:

1. What is Kafka Connect, and what is its purpose?   
- Kafka Connect is a framework for streaming data between Apache Kafka and external data systems. 
   It simplifies the integration of Kafka with other systems by providing scalable, fault-tolerant connectors 
   for ingesting data into Kafka (source connectors) and exporting data from Kafka (sink connectors).

2. What are the key components of Kafka Connect?
- Kafka Connect consists of three main components:
    - Connectors: Plugins responsible for moving data between Kafka and external systems.
    - Workers: JVM processes responsible for running connector tasks and managing their configurations.
    - Converters: Components responsible for serializing and deserializing data between Kafka and external systems.

3. What is the role of a connector in Kafka Connect?
- Connectors are responsible for moving data between Kafka and external systems. 
   They handle tasks such as reading data from a source system and writing it to Kafka (source connectors) or 
   reading data from Kafka and writing it to a sink system (sink connectors).

4. How do you configure Kafka Connect connectors?
- Kafka Connect connectors are configured using JSON files or REST API calls. 
   Configuration parameters include connector class, Kafka topics, data format, and connector-specific properties.

5. What are the differences between source connectors and sink connectors?
- Source connectors ingest data from external systems and write it to Kafka topics, while 
   sink connectors consume data from Kafka topics and write it to external systems. 
   Source connectors pull data into Kafka, whereas sink connectors push data out of Kafka.

6. How does Kafka Connect ensure fault tolerance and scalability?
- Kafka Connect provides fault tolerance and scalability through distributed workers and connector tasks. 
   Connectors and tasks are horizontally scalable and can be distributed across multiple worker nodes. 
   Connector configurations and statuses are managed centrally by Kafka Connect's internal storage.

7. What are some commonly used Kafka Connect connectors?
   - Commonly used Kafka Connect connectors include connectors for databases 
   (e.g., JDBC source/sink connectors), file systems (e.g., FileStream source/sink connectors), 
   cloud services (e.g., AWS S3 sink connector), and messaging systems (e.g., MQTT source connector).

8. How do you monitor and manage Kafka Connect clusters?
- Kafka Connect clusters can be monitored and managed using tools like the Kafka Connect REST API, 
   Confluent Control Center, and third-party monitoring solutions. 
   Metrics such as connector status, throughput, and error rates can be monitored to ensure smooth operation.

9. What is the role of converters in Kafka Connect?
   - Converters are responsible for serializing and deserializing data between Kafka and external systems. 
   They handle data conversion tasks such as encoding data into Kafka's binary format and decoding data from external formats like JSON or Avro.

10. How do you handle schema evolution in Kafka Connect?
    - Kafka Connect supports schema evolution through the use of compatible schema changes and serializers/deserializers (e.g., Avro or JSON Schema). 
    Connectors can be configured to handle schema changes gracefully by specifying compatibility settings and using schema registries for schema management.

# SMTs (Single Message Transformations)
Kafka Single Message Transformations (SMTs) are a feature provided by Apache Kafka Connect. 
They allow you to modify individual messages as they pass through Kafka Connect connectors. 
SMTs provide a way to perform lightweight, in-flight transformations on data 
    without requiring additional external processing.

Here are some key points about Kafka SMTs:

1. **Single Message Transformations**: SMTs operate on a single message at a time as 
    it flows through Kafka Connect pipelines. 
    Each message is transformed independently of other messages.

2. **Connector Integration**: SMTs are integrated into Kafka Connect connectors and 
    can be applied to both source connectors (which ingest data into Kafka) and sink connectors (which export data from Kafka).

3. **Common Use Cases**: SMTs are often used for tasks such as data enrichment, filtering, 
    field renaming, and data masking. 
    They allow you to manipulate message contents, headers, or other metadata based on predefined rules.

4. **Built-in Transformations**: Kafka Connect provides a set of built-in SMTs that 
cover common use cases. 
These include `ExtractField`, `RenameField`, `MaskField`, `SetSchemaMetadata`, and more. 
These transformations can be configured directly within connector configurations.

5. **Custom Transformations**: In addition to built-in SMTs, you can develop custom transformations tailored to your specific requirements. 
Custom SMTs are implemented as Java classes that extend the `org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.Transformation` interface.

6. **Configuration Flexibility**: SMTs can be configured using simple configuration properties, making them easy to use and configure within Kafka Connect connector configurations. 
You can specify SMTs as part of connector configurations to apply transformations to all messages processed by the connector.

Example: RenameField
properties file : 
    name=my-source-connector
    connector.class=...
    tasks.max=...
    # Other connector configurations...

    # Configure SMTs
    transforms=renameField
    transforms.renameField.type=org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.RenameField$Value
    transforms.renameField.renames=first_name:firstName

original message
    {
        "id": 123,
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe"
    }

Transformed message
    {
        "id": 123,
        "firstName": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe"
    }
