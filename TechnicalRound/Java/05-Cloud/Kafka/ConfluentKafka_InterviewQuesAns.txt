1. What is Kafka
	-> Apache Kafka is a streaming platform that is free and open-source. 
	-> Kafka was first built at LinkedIn as a messaging queue, but it has evolved into much more. 
	-> It's a versatile tool for working with data streams that may be applied to a variety of scenarios.

	-> Kafka is a distributed system, which means it can scale up as needed. 
	-> All you have to do now is add new Kafka nodes (servers) to the cluster.
	
	-> Kafka can process a large amount of data in a short amount of time. 
	-> It also has low latency, making it possible to process data in real-time. 
	-> Although Apache Kafka is written in Scala and Java, it may be used with a variety of different programming languages.

	-> Traditional message queues, like RabbitMQ, are not the same as Kafka. 
		-> RabbitMQ eliminates messages immediately after the consumer confirms them, whereas Kafka keeps them for a period of time (default is 7 days) 
			after they've been received. 
		
		-> RabbitMQ also sends messages to consumers and monitors their load. 
			It determines how many messages each consumer should be processing at any one time. 
		On the other hand, Consumers can retrieve messages from Kafka by pulling. 
			It is built to be scalable horizontally by adding more nodes.

	-> It is used for fault-tolerant storage as well as publishing and subscribing to a stream of records. 
	-> The programs are intended to process timing and consumption records. 
	-> Kafka replicates log partitions from many hosts. 
	
	-> Developers and users contribute coding updates, which it keeps, reads, and analyses in real-time. 
		For messaging, website activity tracking, log aggregation, and commit logs, Kafka is employed. 
		Although Kafka can be used as a database, it lacks a data schema and indexes.

2. Features of Kafka
	-> Kafka is a messaging system built for high throughput and fault tolerance.
	-> Kafka has a built-in patriation system known as a Topic.
	-> Kafka Includes a replication feature as well.
	-> Kafka provides a queue that can handle large amounts of data and move messages from one sender to another.
	-> Kafka can also save the messages to storage and replicate them across the cluster.
	-> For coordination and synchronization with other services, Kafka collaborates with Zookeeper.
	-> Apache Spark is well supported by Kafka.
