1. What is Kafka Streams, and how does it differ from Kafka Consumer API?
   - Kafka Streams is a client library for building real-time stream processing applications using Apache Kafka. 
   It allows developers to consume, process, and produce data streams directly within the Kafka ecosystem, 
   without the need for external stream processing frameworks. 
   Unlike the Kafka Consumer API, which requires developers to manage low-level details like offset management and partition assignments, 
   Kafka Streams provides a high-level abstraction for stream processing tasks, making it easier to develop and maintain stream processing applications.

2. What are the key components of Kafka Streams?
   - Kafka Streams consists of several key components, including:
     - Stream Processor: The main processing unit in Kafka Streams that performs transformations and aggregations on input data streams.
     - Topology: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) that defines the flow of data processing operations in a Kafka Streams application.
     - Source and Sink Nodes: Nodes in the topology that represent input and output topics where data is read from and written to.
     - State Stores: Local state storage for storing intermediate results and maintaining application state.

3. How does Kafka Streams ensure fault tolerance and scalability?
   - Kafka Streams provides fault tolerance and scalability through the use of Kafka's built-in features 
   such as data replication, partitioning, and fault tolerance mechanisms like leader election and recovery. 
   Additionally, Kafka Streams applications can be horizontally scaled by running multiple instances of 
   the application across multiple machines or containers.

4. What are the different types of stream processing operations supported by Kafka Streams?
- Kafka Streams supports a wide range of stream processing operations, including:
    - Map and FlatMap: Transformations that apply a function to each input record and produce zero or more output records.
    - Filter: Operation that filters out records based on a predicate.
    - Windowing: Operations that group records into fixed-size or time-based windows for aggregation.
    - Join: Operations that combine records from multiple input streams based on a common key.
    - Aggregation: Operations that compute aggregate statistics (e.g., sum, count, average) over a window of records.

5. How do you handle stateful stream processing in Kafka Streams?
   - Kafka Streams provides built-in support for stateful stream processing through the use of state stores, 
   which allow applications to maintain and update state across multiple input records. 
   State stores are partitioned and fault-tolerant, ensuring that state is consistent and durable even in the presence of failures.

6. What is the role of a Kafka Streams application in a streaming data pipeline?
   - Kafka Streams applications play a central role in streaming data pipelines by 
   consuming data from Kafka topics, 
   performing stream processing tasks (e.g., filtering, aggregation, joining), and 
   producing processed data back to Kafka or other external systems. 
   Kafka Streams applications can be deployed as standalone applications, microservices, or part of larger data processing pipelines.

7. How do you handle schema evolution and compatibility in Kafka Streams applications?
   - Kafka Streams applications can handle schema evolution and compatibility through the use of schema registries and serialization formats like Avro or Protobuf. 
   By registering schemas with a schema registry and using compatible schema evolution strategies, Kafka Streams applications can ensure that data schemas remain backward and forward compatible as the application evolves over time.

# Kafka Stream low level methods
In Apache Kafka Streams, the Stream DSL (Domain Specific Language) provides a high-level abstraction for building stream processing applications. 
However, sometimes you may need to use low-level methods to achieve certain tasks or optimizations. 
Here are some common low-level methods available in the Kafka Streams DSL:
These low-level methods provide flexibility and control over stream processing logic in Kafka Streams applications. 
They allow you to perform custom transformations, enrichments, or other operations on individual records in the stream, 
    complementing the high-level operations provided by the Stream DSL.

1. **transform()**:
   - This method allows you to apply a Processor instance to each record in the stream.
   - It provides access to the Processor API, allowing you to perform arbitrary operations on the records.
   - You can use this method when you need fine-grained control over record processing or when you want to integrate with existing Processor implementations.

2. **process()**:
   - Similar to `transform()`, this method allows you to apply a Processor instance to each record in the stream.
   - However, `process()` provides a more simplified API compared to `transform()`, making it easier to use for simple record processing tasks.
   - You can use this method when you need to perform custom processing logic on each record in the stream.

3. **transformValues()**:
   - This method is similar to `transform()`, but it operates on the values of records in the stream.
   - It allows you to apply a ValueTransformer instance to each record's value, transforming it as needed.
   - You can use this method when you need to modify or enrich the values of records in the stream.

4. **processValues()**:
   - Similar to `transformValues()`, this method allows you to apply a ValueTransformer instance to each record's value.
   - It provides a simplified API compared to `transformValues()`, making it easier to use for simple value transformation tasks.

5. **transformKeys()** and **processKeys()**:
   - These methods are similar to `transformValues()` and `processValues()`, but they operate on the keys of records in the stream.
   - They allow you to apply a KeyTransformer instance to each record's key, transforming it as needed.
   - You can use these methods when you need to modify or enrich the keys of records in the stream.
