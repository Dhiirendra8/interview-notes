# Give me questions at Kafka senior developer at Bloom's revised taxonomy level 4
### **Bloom‚Äôs Revised Taxonomy Level 4: Analyzing**  
At **Level 4 (Analyzing)**, questions should focus on breaking down Kafka concepts, identifying patterns, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing performance in Kafka-based systems.  

Below are **senior-level Apache Kafka questions** that test a candidate‚Äôs ability to analyze, diagnose, and optimize Kafka-based architectures.

---

### **1. Kafka Architecture & Message Flow Analysis**  
- Describe the **end-to-end flow** of a Kafka message from producer to consumer.  
  - What are the key components involved?  
  - How does Kafka ensure message durability and fault tolerance?  
  - What happens if a broker in a Kafka cluster crashes? How does leader election work?

---

### **2. Partitioning Strategy Analysis**  
- Given the following Kafka producer configuration:  
  ```java
  Properties props = new Properties();
  props.put("bootstrap.servers", "broker1:9092,broker2:9092");
  props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
  props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
  props.put("acks", "all");
  ```
  - How does Kafka determine which partition a message will go to?  
  - What happens if a key is **null**?  
  - How would you analyze and choose between **custom partitioning** and Kafka‚Äôs default partitioning strategy?

---

### **3. Consumer Group & Offset Management Analysis**  
- Consider a scenario where a Kafka consumer is **experiencing message duplication**.  
  - What are the possible causes?  
  - How would you diagnose whether the issue is caused by **offset management**, **producer retries**, or **consumer rebalancing**?  
  - How does **auto.offset.reset** affect message consumption?

---

### **4. High Throughput vs. Low Latency Trade-off Analysis**  
- You have a Kafka producer that must handle **100,000 events per second** with low latency.  
  - How would you optimize the producer configuration for high throughput?  
  - What trade-offs would you make between **batch size**, **linger.ms**, and **compression.type**?  
  - How does **acks=all** impact performance compared to **acks=1**?

---

### **5. Troubleshooting Lag in Kafka Consumers**  
- Your team reports that Kafka consumers are experiencing **high lag**.  
  - How would you analyze and debug the issue?  
  - What Kafka metrics would you check to diagnose the root cause?

- Suppose you are processing a **continuous stream of sensor data** using Kafka Streams.  
  ```java
  KStream<String, Double> sensorData = builder.stream("sensor-topic");
  sensorData.groupByKey()
            .windowedBy(TimeWindows.of(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
            .reduce(Double::sum);
  ```
  - What challenges might arise if there is **late-arriving data**?  
  - How would you modify this pipeline to ensure **correct aggregation**?  
  - How does Kafka Streams handle **stateful processing**, and what are the implications for fault tolerance?

---

### **7. Replication Factor & Data Loss Analysis**  
- A Kafka topic has `replication.factor = 2` and a broker crashes.  
  - What happens to **uncommitted messages** in the leader partition?  
  - How does Kafka determine the new leader?  
  - How would increasing the **replication factor** affect performance and reliability?

---

### **8. Kafka Security Analysis**  
- A financial application must **secure Kafka messages** to prevent unauthorized access.  
  - What security mechanisms does Kafka offer for **authentication, authorization, and encryption**?  
  - How would you configure **SASL, ACLs, and TLS** in a production Kafka cluster?  
  - What security risks remain even after enabling SSL encryption?

---

### **9. Kafka Connect & Data Pipeline Analysis**  
- You are using Kafka Connect to stream data from **MySQL to Kafka**.  
  - What factors should you analyze when choosing between **JDBC Source Connector** and **Debezium CDC Connector**?  
  - What problems might arise due to **schema evolution**, and how can you handle them?  
  - How does Kafka ensure **exactly-once delivery** in connectors?

---

### **10. Analyzing Kafka in Multi-Data Center Deployments**  
- Your company wants to replicate Kafka topics across **two geographically distributed data centers**.  
  - What challenges arise in **cross-cluster replication**?  
  - How would you analyze the trade-offs between **MirrorMaker 2** and **Confluent Replicator**?  
  - What factors affect **latency, consistency, and failover** in multi-cluster Kafka setups?

---

### **Summary**  
These **Kafka Level 4 (Analyzing) questions** assess a senior developer‚Äôs ability to:  
‚úîÔ∏è Troubleshoot Kafka issues and diagnose bottlenecks  
‚úîÔ∏è Compare different Kafka configurations and partitioning strategies  
‚úîÔ∏è Analyze trade-offs in performance, security, and fault tolerance  
‚úîÔ∏è Evaluate complex Kafka workflows (Streams, Connect, Multi-DC setups)  

Would you like me to focus on **real-world problem scenarios** or specific areas like **Kafka Streams, performance tuning, or security**? üöÄ

#Give me questions at Kafka senior developer at Bloom's revised taxonomy level 5
### **Bloom‚Äôs Revised Taxonomy Level 5: Evaluating**  
At **Level 5 (Evaluating)**, questions focus on **justifying decisions, comparing solutions, and assessing trade-offs** in a **Kafka-based architecture**.
