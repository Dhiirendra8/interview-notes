Great question! Since Spring `@Controller` is a **singleton** by default, and **all HTTP requests** are routed through this **single instance**, handling **concurrent requests safely** is crucial.

---

## ✅ The Good News:

**Spring handles concurrent requests automatically**, as long as:

> ✅ You **don’t use shared mutable fields** inside the controller class.

---

## 🚫 What **not** to do (Thread-unsafe):

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    private String username; // ❌ shared field, not thread-safe!

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello(@RequestParam String name) {
        this.username = name;       // ❌ BAD: shared field
        return "Hello " + username;
    }
}
```

If multiple users call `/hello?name=John` and `/hello?name=Alice` at the same time, they'll overwrite each other's data.

---

## ✅ What **to do** (Thread-safe):

Use **method-local variables** only:

```java
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public ResponseEntity<String> sayHello(@RequestParam String name) {
        String response = "Hello " + name;  // ✅ method-local variable
        return ResponseEntity.ok(response);
    }
}
```

* `name` and `response` are **stack variables**, created separately for each thread/request.
* This is **thread-safe** and works perfectly under high concurrency.

## 🧠 Other Patterns to Handle Concurrency:

| Approach                    | When to Use                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Method-local variables      | ✅ Default & safest for all controllers                         |
| `@RequestScope` beans       | For request-specific dependencies (e.g., user info)            |
| Thread-safe components      | Use `ConcurrentHashMap`, `AtomicInteger`, etc. for shared data |
| Synchronization (carefully) | Only if critical section is needed (rare in REST controllers)  |
| Async handling (`@Async`)   | For background processing without blocking                     |

---

## ⚠️ Reminder:

Even though the controller is a singleton, **Spring Boot creates a new thread for each incoming HTTP request** (managed by Tomcat/Jetty). So **each method call is executed in its own thread**, and as long as **you don’t share mutable state**, you're safe.

### ✅ Summary:

| Concern               | Solution                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Singleton controller  | ✔️ Okay — just don’t use shared fields        |
| Concurrent requests   | ✔️ Handled automatically (new thread/request) |
| Request-specific data | ✔️ Use method variables or `@RequestScope`    |
