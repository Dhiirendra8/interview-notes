1. CrudRepository 
    -> provides CRUD functions
2. PagingAndSortingRepository 
    -> provides methods to do pagination and sort records
3. JpaRepository 
    -> provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch

    And so, because of this inheritance relationship, 
        the JpaRepository contains the full API of CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository.




#Downsides of Spring Data Repositories
-1. we couple our code to the library and to its specific abstractions, such as `Page` or `Pageable`; 
    that's of course not unique to this library – but we do have to be careful not to expose these internal implementation details
-2. by extending e.g. CrudRepository, we expose a complete set of persistence method at once. 
    This is probably fine in most circumstances as well but we might run into situations where we'd like to gain more fine-grained 
    control over the methods exposed, e.g. to create a ReadOnlyRepository that doesn't include the save(…) and delete(…) 
    methods of CrudRepository
