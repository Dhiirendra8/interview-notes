ANSWERS
Here are detailed answers to advanced JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Boot testing interview questions for developers with 8+ years of experience:
________________________________________
Core JUnit Questions
1.	Difference between JUnit 4 and JUnit 5:
o	JUnit 5 has modular architecture: JUnit Platform, Jupiter (API), and Vintage (for JUnit 4).
o	Uses org.junit.jupiter instead of org.junit.
o	Supports lambda expressions and dynamic tests.

2.	JUnit 5 Annotations:
o	@Test, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @BeforeAll, @AfterAll, @Disabled, @Nested, @Tag

3.	Grouping or tagging tests:
o	Use @Tag("integration") and filter via build tool or test runner.

4.	Parameterized Tests:
o	Use @ParameterizedTest with sources like @ValueSource, @CsvSource, or @MethodSource.

5.	Testing for exceptions:
o	Use assertThrows(Exception.class, () -> { /* code */ });

6.	Testing private methods:
o	Prefer testing via public interface. Use reflection only if absolutely necessary.

7.	Nested Tests in JUnit 5:
o	Use @Nested to group related tests inside an outer test class.

8.	@BeforeEach vs @BeforeAll:
o	@BeforeEach runs before every test method. @BeforeAll runs once per class (must be static).
________________________________________
Mockito and Mocking Questions
9.	@Mock, @Spy, @InjectMocks:
o	@Mock: Create mock object.
o	@Spy: Partial mock (real methods unless stubbed).
o	@InjectMocks: Inject mocks into the object being tested.

10.	How Mockito works:
•	Uses dynamic proxies and subclassing to intercept method calls and return mocked responses.

11.	Mocking void methods:
•	Use doNothing().when(mock).method(); or doThrow().when(mock).method();

12.	Verifying invocations:
•	Use verify(mock, times(1)).method();

13.	doReturn().when() vs when().thenReturn():
•	Use doReturn() for spies or when mocking final methods or avoiding side effects.
14.	Mocking static methods or constructors:
•	Use Mockito.mockStatic() (Mockito 3.4+), or PowerMock for older versions.
15.	ArgumentCaptor:
•	Captures arguments passed to mocks: ArgumentCaptor<Type> captor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(Type.class);
16.	Mock final classes/methods:
•	Possible with Mockito 2.x+ if mock maker inline is enabled via mockito-inline.
________________________________________
Spring Boot Testing
17.	@SpringBootTest vs @WebMvcTest vs @DataJpaTest:
•	@SpringBootTest: Full context.
•	@WebMvcTest: MVC slice only (no DB).
•	@DataJpaTest: JPA and repositories only.

18.	Integration tests:
•	Use @SpringBootTest, actual DB, TestRestTemplate or MockMvc.

19.	Mock beans in context:
•	Use @MockBean to mock and inject into context.

20.	@TestConfiguration:
•	Create test-specific beans/configuration within tests.

21.	@MockBean vs @SpyBean:
•	@MockBean: Replace a bean with a mock.
•	@SpyBean: Spy on a real Spring bean.

22.	Testing REST with MockMvc:
•	Use mockMvc.perform(...) and validate response with .andExpect(...)

23.	TestRestTemplate:
•	Used in integration tests to make real HTTP calls to running Spring Boot app.

24.	Kafka testing:
•	Use embedded Kafka or mock producer/consumer with Spring Kafka Test utilities.
________________________________________
Advanced & Best Practices
25.	Test doubles:
•	Types: Dummy, Stub, Fake, Mock, Spy.
26.	Test structure:
•	Use “Arrange-Act-Assert” structure, group by feature.
27.	Test async code:
•	Use CompletableFuture.get(), CountDownLatch, or Awaitility.
28.	Flaky tests:
•	Root cause analysis, isolation, and using retries or stabilization mechanisms.
29.	Unit vs Integration vs E2E:
•	Unit: single class/method. Integration: multiple layers. E2E: real app + external systems.
30.	Test data management:
•	Use @Sql, TestEntityManager, factory methods, or DB migration tools.
31.	Code coverage tools:
•	JaCoCo, Cobertura. Look for missed branches, not just lines.
32.	Isolating tests in microservices:
•	Use mocks, TestContainers, contract tests, in-memory DBs.
33.	Testing time-dependent code:
•	Use Clock abstraction or libraries like Mockito to mock LocalDate.now().
34.	Testing caching logic:
•	Use @Cacheable + cache manager + verify caching behavior with spy or TTL wait.
________________________________________
Real-World Scenarios
35.	External API testing:
•	Use WebClient + mock server (MockWebServer, WireMock), or wrap API in a service.
36.	Simulating failures:
•	Use doThrow(), timeout mocks, fallback patterns.
37.	Contract tests:
•	Use tools like Pact to verify message or HTTP contracts.
38.	Testcontainers:
•	Spin up real DBs (PostgreSQL, Kafka) in Docker during test runtime.
39.	Assertion libraries:
•	Use AssertJ for fluent, readable assertions: assertThat(x).isEqualTo(y);
40.	Testing in CI/CD:
•	Use stages: unit → integration → smoke → e2e, with parallel test execution, proper cleanup, and isolated environments.
